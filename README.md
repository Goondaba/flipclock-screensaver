# FlipClock

A simple flip clock screen saver written with SceneKit.
Requires at least 10.8 Mountain Lion.

## How To Build FlipClock

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Once CocoaPods is installed, run the following command within the project directory:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### The FlipClock project has two targets:
- FlipClock : The screensaver plugin.
- ClockDemo : A standalone application useful for testing.
